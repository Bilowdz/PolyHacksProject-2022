# Worst Alarm Clock in the world


This torture device is meant to force the user to wake up quickly and efficiently. The premise is that a random game from the pool implemented within this alarm clock will begin once the "stop alarm" button is pressed. The alarm will continue to ring and torture the user not only physically but also mentally, slowly driving them to madness as they attempt to win today's game. The games are random so that the user cannot expect any given game.



This program was developed by Simon Bilodeau, Ryan Hanniff, and Pate Lauzon for the PolyHacks 2022 event. Feel free to use any part of this project for yourself if you somehow find any use for it.



The alarm clock and random game system was implemented by us, while the games were found here on github.
